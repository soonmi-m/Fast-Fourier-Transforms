# Fast-Fourier Transform

This problem was inspired by a common occurrence with some pet owners – a dog swallowing a marble. Although ultrasounds provide three-dimensional spatial data, because of the nature of dogs and internal fluid, there is not an apparent clear pathway of the marble moving through the dog’s intestines and only noisy signals are obtained. In order to locate and compute the trajectory of the marble, 20 different spatial ultrasound measurements were taken and Fast Fourier Transforms and Gaussian filtering were used.
